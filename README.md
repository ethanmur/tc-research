# tc-research

I've generally split this github directory up into a few folders. All of my up to date and useful code and helper scripts can be found in the code folder.
All of my older, less useful code can be found in the code-older directory. I saved some of my figures automatically in the figures folder, especially when used
to create gifs of TC motion. tdr-detailed analysis is a folder with code and test directories in my seemingly futile attempts to get higher resolution radar data
from solo3 and lrose. All of my data is stored locally on my computer becuase of privacy and uploading it would take forever.
