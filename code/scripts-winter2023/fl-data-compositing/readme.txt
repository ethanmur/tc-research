Purpose of these scripts:
- these scripts were intended to download flight level data, process it, and
  save figures in a separate, cleaner environment. Currently, though, none of
  these scripts are both working or different from the scripts in "scripts/plotting"
- fl_time_esries_new_noaa_data.py was attempting to use a new data structure for
  making plots: instead of looking in "data / year" folders, it was looking in
  "data / year / name" folders. I decided that this was too cumbersome of an
  approach, so I gave up lol.

- it might be useful to delete these scripts and put the working ones in their
  place! And then simplify / improve code from there
